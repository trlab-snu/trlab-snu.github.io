## Public Transportation
We aim to successfully optimize public transportation that significantly affects the mobility of citizens. [For detailed information, click here.](<https://trlab-snu.github.io/research_area/public_transportation>)

## Reinforcement Learning based Operational Strategy
We analyze and understand the behavior of mobility services and establish an agent who can mimic human behavior. [For detailed information, click here.](<https://trlab-snu.github.io/research_area/reinforcement_learning>)

## Data-Based Learning and Information Generation
Based on various methodologies, including deep learning, we analyze patterns and generate future information by grasping the meaning contained in the data. [For detailed information, click here.](<https://trlab-snu.github.io/research_area/data_based_learning>)

## Autonomous Driving and Safety
We research and evaluate micro-scale manipulation methods for the reliable operation of autonomous vehicles. [For detailed information, click here.](<https://trlab-snu.github.io/research_area/autonomous_driving_and_safety>)

## Optimization Strategy
We develop strategies for effective transportation use, where huge social capital is invested. [For detailed information, click here.](<https://trlab-snu.github.io/research_area/optimization_strategy>)
